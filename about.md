**About me**

I'm (Przemysław) working as java software developer since 2007, mostly with spring stack. I live in Poland in Gdańsk city.       

**About this blog**

I plan to put here my after work projects, hobby.
I always liked to build (furniture, software, hardware...), and now I would to share some of them.
